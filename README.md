# Redux observable (and saga) example

## Start

```sh
yarn     # install
yarn start # start
```

## Todo

- add more epics/rxjs examples
- fix puppy-components so that they are more usable
- work on npm `with-http-reducer` package and make sure saga payloads are applied correctly - higher order reducer in commit `079973d` works but it would be nice to abstract this away from the project
